        <h2>About the Creator</h2>
        <p class="intro">
            This website was created by a young an passionate  student web developer with a strong
            interest in digital innovation, wildlife conservation, and tourism development. The idea
            behind this platform came from a desire to use technology as a tool to promote
            the beauty, value, and global importance of Serengeti National Park.
        </p>
        <img src="Images/marley.jpg" alt="">
        <p>
            As a student who still learning and growing in the field of web development, the creator
            chose to build this platform not for commercial gain, but as a practical project to 
            demostrate skills, creativity, and commitment to meaningfull causes.
            Serengeti is one of Africa's most iconic natural treasures, and this website aims to contribute,
            in a small but sincere way, to raising awareness about its wildlife, landscapes, and 
            conservation value through digital storytelling.
        </p>
        <p>
            This project also reflects a belief that young people can play an active role in 
            national development by applying digital skills to real-word challenges.
            By combining web design, visual content, and informative sections, the creator
            hopes this platform can inspire others-especially youth-to appreciate nature,
            support sustainable tourism, and think creatively about how technology can support
            conservation efforts.
        </p>
        <p>
            The website remains open for learning, improvement, and collaboration, and it
            represents both a personal learning journey and a vision how digital platforms
            can support tourism awareness and environmental responsibility.
